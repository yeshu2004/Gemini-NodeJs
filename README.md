### Getting Started

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your **API_KEY**:
    ```
    API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    ```

#### Usage

1. Start the project:
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

2. Interact with the application in the terminal by typing your queries. Type `exit` to quit.

#### File Structure

- `index.js`: Main file for the chat functionality.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables like your API key (ensure it is added to `.gitignore`).

#### Troubleshooting

- **If you get rate limits:** You can only make 15 requests per minute. Try again later or optimize requests.
- **If the model is overloaded:** Wait a moment and try again.
